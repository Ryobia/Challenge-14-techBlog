## Description 
  So basically it's just a really simple blog where you can post and comment on posts. nothing fancy but it works. Using api endpoints and sequelize this very generic blog allows for multiple users to post as much as they like and it lets everyone see those posts and comment on them as they please. The person posting is also able to edit and delete their own posts. Also in place is an idle/timeout for a user's session set to one minute because server space is limited and like, if you're not using the site then get off ya know?
